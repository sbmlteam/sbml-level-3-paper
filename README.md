SBML Level 3 Paper submitted 2020<img width="14%" align="right" src=".graphics/sbml-badge.svg">
=================================

This repository contains (as submodules) components of a paper on SBML Level&nbsp;3 submitted to _Molecular Systems Biology_ in 2020.  The paper was developed by the authors on Overleaf, and once submitted, a copy of the git repository from Overleaf was put on GitHub (in [sbml-level-3-overleaf](https://github.com/sbmlteam/sbml-level-3-paper-overleaf)).  The response to the reviewer comments was made a separate document in [sbml-level-3-paper-response-letter](https://github.com/sbmlteam/sbml-level-3-paper-response-letter) and our response to reviewers included `latexdiff` output comparing the version that reviewers saw and the revised version, in [sbml-level-3-paper-diff](https://github.com/sbmlteam/sbml-level-3-paper-diff).  Note that these repositories are installed here as git submodules.  To download everything, you need to use the `--recursive` option to the `git clone` command.

The subdirectory [submitted-files](submitted-files) contains copies of the files uploaded as part of the journal submission.  The source files (`.tex`, `.cls`, etc.) are copies of the files created from the sources in the repositories mentioned above.  Sometimes the files were renamed to make their purpose more clear in the collection of files uploaded via the journal website.  For example, [submitted-files/draft-style.cls](submitted-files/draft-style.cls) is identical to [sbml-paper.cls](https://github.com/sbmlteam/sbml-level-3-paper-overleaf/blob/master/sbml-paper.cls) in the original manuscript repository, but renamed during submission because it made the role of the file more clear in the journal upload web interface.
